Conclusion and Future Scope 
6.1
 Conclusion: 
The Eco-Efficient CPU Scheduling Algorithm provides a comprehensive solution for 
energy- constrained computing environments requiring balanced performance and power 
efficiency. By implementing a three-module architecture (Workload Analysis and 
Prediction, Energy- Aware Scheduling Core, and Simulation/Evaluation Framework), the 
algorithm delivers intelligent power management while maintaining system 
responsiveness. The workload- aware approach enables proactive scheduling decisions 
that significantly reduce energy consumption compared to traditional schedulers, 
particularly in mobile and embedded systems where battery life is critical.
