2.1. Module 1: Workload Analysis and Prediction Engine 
Purpose: The Workload Analysis and Prediction Engine serves as the intelligence behind 
energy-efficient scheduling decisions. It continuously monitors system behavior, analyzes 
execution patterns, and predicts future computational demands. By understanding workload 
characteristics and forecasting future needs, this module enables proactive resource allocation 
that minimizes energy consumption while ensuring performance requirements are met. 
Role: This module collects and analyzes execution metrics, classifies tasks based on their 
computational and energy profiles, predicts future workload patterns, and provides this 
intelligence to the scheduling core for making informed decisions about task execution 
timing, core assignment, and frequency scaling. 
2.2. Module 2: Energy-Aware Scheduling Core 
Purpose: The Energy-Aware Scheduling Core is responsible for making optimal task 
scheduling decisions that balance performance requirements with energy efficiency goals. It 
determines which tasks run on which cores, when they execute, and at what processor 
frequencies, all while minimizing overall power consumption and meeting performance 
constraints. 
Role: The Energy-Aware Scheduling Core serves as the central decision-making component 
that integrates inputs from the Workload Analysis module with system power states to 
produce an energy-optimized execution plan. It implements scheduling policies, manages 
task queues, controls DVFS settings, and orchestrates transitions between power states to 
achieve the best possible energy efficiency. 
2.3. Module 3: Simulation and Evaluation Framework 
Purpose: The Simulation and Evaluation Framework provides tools to test, validate, and 
visualize the performance of the energy-efficient scheduling algorithm across various 
scenarios without requiring physical hardware implementation. It enables rapid development 
iterations, comprehensive testing, and detailed analysis of energy and performance metrics. 
Role: This module provides a simulated environment for algorithm development and testing, 
generates realistic workloads, collects performance and energy metrics, visualizes results, and 
allows comparison with traditional scheduling approaches to quantify improvements.
