4.1. Web Technologies: 
1.  HTML (HyperText Markup Language) 
o Used for structuring the user interface and displaying scheduling information. 
o Provides the foundation for visualizing core scheduling metrics and system 
status. 
o Suitable for creating interactive dashboards to monitor performance. 
Use cases: 
o Building the framework for scheduling visualization tools. 
o Displaying real-time system metrics (CPU usage, frequency scaling, etc.). 
o Creating configuration forms for scheduling parameters. 
2.
 CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) 
o Used for styling and layout of scheduling visualization tools. 
o Provides responsive design capabilities for different screen sizes. 
o Enables clear visualization of complex scheduling data through animations and 
transitions. 
Use cases: 
o Designing intuitive dashboards for monitoring scheduler performance. 
o Creating visual hierarchies to represent task priorities. 
o Styling interactive elements for configuration and control. 
3.
 JavaScript 
o Used for implementing interactive scheduling simulations in the browser. 
o Provides event-driven programming for user interactions with scheduling 
controls. 
o Supports Web APIs for performance monitoring and visualization. 
o Enables integration with backend services through AJAX or WebSockets. 
Use cases: 
o Building browser-based scheduling simulators. 
o Creating dynamic visualizations of scheduling algorithms. 
o Implementing interactive DVFS (Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling) 
demonstrations. 
o Developing web-based tools for analyzing scheduling performance. 
4.2.  Libraries and Tools
