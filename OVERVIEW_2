standards and provides clear guidance for implementing the algorithm in 
various operating systems. 
o Energy optimization guidelines: Comprehensive documentation on how to 
configure the scheduler for different energy profiles and hardware capabilities. 
o Performance tuning parameters: Documentation on how to adjust the 
algorithm to prioritize either energy savings or performance based on specific 
use cases. 
4. Testing and Validation:  
o Energy efficiency measurements: Quantitative analysis of energy savings 
compared to traditional schedulers across various workloads and device types. 
o Performance impact assessment: Detailed measurements of the performance 
impact under different workloads, including real-time, interactive, and 
background tasks. 
o Thermal behavior analysis: Assessment of how the scheduler affects device 
thermal characteristics and throttling behavior. 
1.3. Project Scope 
1. Development of core scheduling mechanisms: The Eco-Efficient CPU Scheduler 
implements three core scheduling mechanisms: Task Classification, Energy-Aware 
Dispatching, and State Transition Management. Each mechanism integrates DVFS 
control, sleep state transitions, and workload prediction. 
2. Design of a consistent API across platforms: The API is designed to work across 
Linux, RTOS environments, and proprietary mobile operating systems, providing a 
unified interface for energy-aware scheduling. 
3. Support for both real-time and best-effort task scheduling: The algorithm 
differentiates between tasks with hard deadlines and those with flexibility in 
execution time. 
4. Implementation of priority-based energy policies: The scheduler enforces energy 
policies based on application priorities, user preferences, and system state. 
5. Performance testing under various workload patterns: Testing includes simulated 
workloads representing mobile gaming, web browsing, video playback, background 
processing, and IoT sensing scenarios. 
6. Support for heterogeneous computing environments: The algorithm can optimize 
task placement across heterogeneous cores (big.LITTLE architecture) for maximum 
energy efficiency. 
7. Integration with existing power management frameworks: Compatibility with 
ACPI, device-specific power management, and mobile platform power APIs. 
8. Simulation tools for algorithm validation: Development of simulation environment 
to test and visualize scheduler behavior before hardware implementation.
