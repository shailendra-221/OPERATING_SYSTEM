1. Project Overview 
The Eco-Efficient CPU Scheduling Algorithm addresses a critical challenge in modern 
computing: balancing performance with energy consumption in resource-constrained 
environments. As mobile devices, IoT systems, and embedded applications become 
increasingly prevalent, energy-efficient scheduling becomes essential for extending battery 
life while maintaining responsive user experiences. 
1.1. Goals 
1. Energy Optimization: Develop a scheduling algorithm that minimizes power 
consumption through:

o Intelligent sleep state management 
o Workload-aware task distribution 
o Thermal-aware scheduling to prevent throttling 
o Energy harvesting awareness for applicable systems 
2. Performance Preservation: Create an algorithm that maintains acceptable 
performance levels:  
o Ensure real-time task deadlines are met 
o Minimize impact on user-perceived responsiveness 
o Adapt to varying computational loads dynamically 
o Provide configurable performance-energy trade-offs 
3. Adaptability and Learning: Design a scheduler that can:  
o Learn from usage patterns to predict future workloads 
o Adapt to changing battery conditions 
o Optimize for different hardware configurations 
o Support various application profiles and priorities 
4. Implementation Feasibility: Ensure the algorithm is:  
o Implementable on existing hardware 
o Lightweight enough for resource-constrained systems 
o Compatible with standard operating system architectures 
o Scalable from single-core to multi-core environments
